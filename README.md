# Todo-website
you can create your todo things

I developed a website that allows users to create and manage their own todo lists using Python and CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. The website uses a database to store the todo list items, which are accessed and modified through a server-side application built with Python and a web framework such as Flask. The client-side of the website is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to view their todo lists, add new items, mark items as complete, and delete items. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using modern technologies and good coding practices.
